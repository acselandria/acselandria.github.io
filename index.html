                Favorite CMSC subject so far and why: It would have to be CMSC 22 because I was able to make something that I didn't
                I could ever make. Although the subject was a bit difficult, being able to see the end product made me feel accomplished.

                Favorite GE so far and why: I haven't taken as much GE as most students in my batch but I can say that the one that's caught my eye
                is Ethics 1 because it tackles about the morality of people and I find it fascinating how diverse people really are in terms of mindset.
            </h3>

            <h3>
                Favorite programming language so far and why: it's safe to say that my favorite is Python because it's syntax is relatively easier
                compared to those that I have learned as I progress in this course.
